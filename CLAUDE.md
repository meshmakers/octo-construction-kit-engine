# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Octo Construction Kit Engine is a .NET-based framework for building and managing data models with Construction Kits. It's part of the Octo Mesh platform, which transforms raw data into meaningful information with proper context.

## Architecture

The codebase follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
- **ConstructionKit.Contracts**: Shared contracts, interfaces, and serialization logic for Construction Kit models
- **ConstructionKit.Engine**: Core engine for processing Construction Kit models
- **ConstructionKit.Compiler**: CLI tool for compiling Construction Kit YAML models
- **ConstructionKit.SourceGeneration**: Source code generation from CK models
- **Runtime.Engine**: Runtime execution engine for processing data
- **Runtime.Contracts**: Runtime contracts and interfaces
- **SystemCkModel**: Base system Construction Kit models

### Construction Kit Model Structure
Construction Kit models are defined in YAML files following a specific schema:
- Models have a unique `modelId` (e.g., "System-1.0.1")
- Models can depend on other models via `dependencies`
- Model definitions are organized in folders: `types/`, `attributes/`, `enums/`, `records/`, `associations/`
- Optional: `migrations/` folder for CK model version migrations

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the entire solution
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Build in debug mode with local packages
dotnet build --configuration DebugL

# Build specific project
dotnet build src/ConstructionKit.Compiler/ConstructionKit.Compiler.csproj
```

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests except system tests
dotnet test --configuration Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~SystemTests"

# Run all tests including system tests
dotnet test --configuration Release

# Run tests for specific project
dotnet test tests/ConstructionKit.Engine.Tests/ConstructionKit.Engine.Tests.csproj

# Run specific test
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestClassName.TestMethodName"
```

## Compiler Usage

The ConstructionKit.Compiler is used to compile YAML model definitions:

```bash
# Compile a Construction Kit model
dotnet run --project src/ConstructionKit.Compiler/ConstructionKit.Compiler.csproj -- \
  -c Compile \
  -p "path/to/ConstructionKit" \
  -o "output/path"

# Generate documentation from compiled model
dotnet run --project src/ConstructionKit.Compiler/ConstructionKit.Compiler.csproj -- \
  -c generateDocs \
  -f "path/to/compiled-model.yaml" \
  -o "docs/output/path" \
  -l "/docs/technologyGuide/constructionKits/libraries/"
```

## Development Configuration

The project uses:
- .NET 9.0 (as of latest update)
- xUnit v3 for testing
- Three build configurations: Debug, Release, DebugL
  - DebugL uses version 999.0.0 for local development
  - DebugL looks for packages in `../nuget` directory

Key MSBuild properties (from Directory.Build.props):
- `OctoCompileCkModel`: Controls CK model compilation (default: true)
- `OctoPublishCkModel`: Controls CK model publishing (default: false)
- `OctoGenerateCkModelServiceClass`: Generate service classes (default: true)

## Code Quality

```bash
# The project enforces warnings as errors - fix all warnings before committing
# C# nullable reference types are enabled - handle nullability appropriately
# Latest major C# language version is used
```

## Working with Construction Kit Models

When modifying CK models:
1. YAML files in `ConstructionKit/` folders define the model structure
2. Models must follow the schema at `https://schemas.meshmakers.cloud/construction-kit-meta.schema.json`
3. After changes, recompile the model using the compiler
4. Generated code will be created based on the model definitions

## JSON Serialization & Newtonsoft Parity

The Rt-model serialization rules are split across two canonical options bundles, both in
`Runtime.Contracts/Serialization/`:

- `RtNewtonsoftSerializer.DefaultSerializer` — pre-migration Newtonsoft setup (used by tests and
  legacy callers). `RtNewtonsoftAttributesConverter` preserves source CLR types through the
  in-memory `JObject.FromObject` / `JToken.ToObject` round-trip (e.g. `int 1` stays `Int32` in
  `JValue.Value`).
- `RtSystemTextJsonSerializer.Default` — STJ counterpart. Has `RtAttributesConverter` for the
  attribute dict, the CK / Rt ID converters, and the **`NewtonsoftParityDoubleConverter` /
  `…SingleConverter` / `…DecimalConverter`** that emit `.0` for whole-number reals (mirroring
  `JsonConvert.ToString`). Without these, `double 0.0` would serialize as `0` and re-deserialize
  as `long` via `JsonScalar.ToClr` — observable as `BsonInt64` regressions in MongoDB.
  It also sets **`Encoder = JavaScriptEncoder.UnsafeRelaxedJsonEscaping`** so serialized output
  matches Newtonsoft byte-for-byte on non-ASCII (umlauts/ß) and HTML chars (`< > &`); STJ's default
  `JavaScriptEncoder` would `\uXXXX`-escape those and diverge from the legacy wire form (breaking
  hash/HMAC parity over serialized bytes). This encoder is the single source of truth and flows into
  `SystemTextJsonOptions.Default` (octo-sdk) and every wire node. **Any consumer that serializes Rt
  data with a raw `Utf8JsonWriter` (e.g. SDK `IDataContext.WriteJsonTo`) must honour it** — pass
  `new JsonWriterOptions { Encoder = SystemTextJsonOptions.Default.Encoder }`.

`JsonScalar.ToClr` is the single source of scalar boxing (`Runtime.Contracts/Serialization/`).
Rules:
- Integers prefer `Int32` (fits in 32 bits), then `Int64`. Matches Newtonsoft's
  `JObject.FromObject(int)` → `JValue.Value=Int32`.
- Reals box to `double`.
- ISO-8601 strings parse to `DateTime` when `parseDateStrings=true`.

The parity contract is enforced by `Sdk.Common.PipelineParityTests` (in octo-sdk) using
Newtonsoft as the oracle. Irreducible divergences (float vs double, decimal vs double,
DateTimeOffset vs DateTime — JSON has no source-CLR-type marker) are listed by name in
`AttributeValueParityCorpus.IrreducibleDivergences`. Consumers needing exact source-CLR-type
preservation must use typed accessors (`GetAttributeValue<decimal>`, typed properties on DTOs).

**RtCkId virtual-property shim.** On the wire an `RtCkId<T>` serialises to a bare
`SemanticVersionedFullName` string, but legacy pipeline YAML drills `.SemanticVersionedFullName` /
`.FullName` expecting the historical object shape. The rule that those two property names on a JSON
string are virtual self-aliases is centralised in **`RtCkIdJsonShim`**
(`ConstructionKit.Contracts/RtCkIdJsonShim.cs`), next to `RtCkId<T>` where the wire shape is decided.
It replaces magic strings formerly duplicated across the SDK walkers (`JsonPathWalker`, `DataOverlay`,
`LayeredSource`), `RtNewtonsoftAttributesConverter`, and the mesh-adapter `CreateUpdateInfoNode`.

## N:M Association Query Columns

N:M (many-to-many) associations are exposed as query columns with `totalCount` and `exists` meta-properties. These allow listing and filtering entities based on whether associations exist and how many there are.

### Path Syntax
```
navigationPropertyName.targetTypeName::totalCount    → INTEGER_64 (count of associations)
navigationPropertyName.targetTypeName::exists        → BOOLEAN (true if count > 0)
```

The `::` separator distinguishes association meta-properties from regular attribute navigation (`->`). This avoids collisions with actual attributes named `totalCount` or `exists` on the target type.

### Key Components
- **CkTypeQueryColumnCollector** (`ConstructionKit.Engine/DependencyGraph/`): Generates `totalCount` and `exists` columns for both outbound and inbound N:M associations. One column per navigation property grouping (not per derived type).
- **AssociationCountFilter** (`Runtime.Contracts/Repositories/Query/`): Record type that carries count filter operator and comparison value on a `NavigationPair`.
- **NavigationPair.AssociationCountFilter**: When set, the MongoDB layer generates a count-based aggregation pipeline instead of the standard existence check.

### MongoDB Pipeline
When `AssociationCountFilter` is set on a `NavigationPair`, `SingleOriginRtQuery.CreateAssociationCountNavigation` generates:
1. `$lookup` on the associations collection (matching by role ID and target type)
2. `$addFields` to compute `$size` of the lookup result
3. `$match` to filter by the count comparison (e.g., `>= 1` for exists)
4. `$project` to clean up temporary fields

### Usage in GraphQL
```graphql
# Filter by existence
fieldFilter: [{
  attributePath: "documents.bankTransaction::exists"
  operator: EQUALS
  comparisonValue: true
}]

# Filter by count
fieldFilter: [{
  attributePath: "documents.bankTransaction::totalCount"
  operator: GREATER_THAN
  comparisonValue: 3
}]
```

## Query Column Collector Guardrails

`CkTypeQueryColumnCollector` walks the association graph to build navigation columns
(`a.Type->b`). Two guardrails protect against pathological CK models (root cause of a production-class
incident: a single transient stream-data query on a tenant with a 0..1 self-association on
the root `System/Entity` type allocated >60 GB and killed the asset-repo service):

- **`CkTypeQueryColumnOptions.MaxColumns`** (default `50_000`, `null` = unlimited): hard cap
  on the total number of produced columns. The per-path cycle guard (`ignoredNavigations`)
  only prevents revisiting the same `(targetType, role)` tuple *within one path* — sibling
  branches re-explore the same subgraph, and `GetAllDerivedTypes` fans each 0..1/1 navigation
  out over every derived type of the target, so densely connected models expand
  combinatorially. When the cap is exceeded the collector throws a `DependencyGraphException`
  (fail fast) instead of allocating unbounded memory. Callers that only need physical
  attribute columns (e.g. stream-data archives) should pass
  `IgnoreNavigationProperties = true` instead of relying on the cap.
- **Record cycle detection**: record descent (`Record` / `RecordArray` attributes) tracks the
  records on the current descent path and throws a `DependencyGraphException` on a cycle
  (a record containing itself directly or transitively) instead of recursing to stack
  overflow.

## Blueprints and Migrations

The project supports two types of migrations:

### Blueprints
Blueprints initialize tenants with pre-configured CK models and runtime data. See `docs/blueprints.md` for details.

Key services:
- `IBlueprintService` - Applies blueprints to tenants

#### Runtime-State Preservation on Re-Import (Upsert)

Any `ImportStrategy.Upsert` import maps to a full `ReplaceOne` in the
MongoDB layer — every attribute on the existing entity is overwritten by
the import model's value, even attributes the author never meant to manage
(deployment status, last-error fields, sync sequence numbers, stream-data
`Archive.Status`, …). Two observable failure modes: a "Deployed" adapter
flips back to "Undeployed" on the next controller restart that picks up a
blueprint version bump (the seed encodes `DeploymentState: 0` as the
fresh-tenant default, AB#4582's sibling), and an **activated stream-data
archive silently reverts to Disabled** on a blueprint re-apply or a plain
`ImportRt -r` (AB#4582 / AB#4589), breaking SD queries with
`STREAMDATA_ARCHIVE_NOT_ACTIVATED`.

The fix is per-attribute, opt-in on the CK side, and lives at the **single
import choke point** so every Upsert caller gets it automatically:

- **CK schema**: `CkAttribute.ownership: SeedOwned | TenantOwned |
  RuntimeState | Secret` (AB#5187), with `isRuntimeState: bool` kept as a
  deprecated alias. See `Serialization/Schema/construction-kit-elements-attribute.schema.json`,
  `AttributeOwnershipDto`, `CkAttributeDto`, and the propagation through
  `CkAttributeGraph` / `CkTypeAttributeGraph`. Existing CK models that set
  neither, or only the boolean, behave exactly as before — see
  "Attribute Ownership" below.
- **Import path (shared)**:
  `ImportRtModelCommand.PreserveRuntimeStateAttributesAsync` runs at the top
  of the private `ImportEntityAsync` choke point — through which **all three**
  public import methods (`ImportModelAsync`, `ImportTextAsync`, `ImportAsync`
  file/stream) funnel — gated on `importStrategy == Upsert`. It groups the
  incoming entities by CK type for one batch repo query per type (on the
  ambient import session/transaction), looks each existing entity up by
  `RtId`, and for every attribute the CK cache says the tenant owns
  (`SelectPreservedAttributes` → effective ownership ≠ `SeedOwned`)
  it overwrites the **imported value** with the **existing value** before the
  bulk write. The repository call is wrapped — a lookup failure logs a
  warning and falls through to imported values rather than blocking the
  import. `Insert` is untouched (it errors on an existing id, so there is
  nothing to preserve).
- **Who benefits**: because it sits in the import command, all Upsert
  callers are covered with no per-caller code:
  - blueprint seed apply (`BlueprintService.ApplySeedDataForBlueprintAsync`
    and the locked/merge import path) — the explicit pre-import preserve call
    that used to live in `BlueprintService` was removed; it is now automatic.
  - the plain `ImportRt -r` CLI path (`octo-bot-services` `ImportModelJob` →
    `ImportAsync`) — the AB#4589 target (voest-app archive re-import).
  - CK-model migration entity writes (`BlueprintMigrationExecutor`, Upsert).
    Note: an additive migration that introduces a new runtime-state attribute
    on a pre-existing entity still lands its value (existing entity has no
    prior value → nothing to preserve); only a migration that *rewrites an
    already-present* runtime-state attribute would be preserved-over — rare,
    and consistent with "an import must never trample runtime state".
- **Per-entity vs. per-attribute lock**: preservation is orthogonal to the
  blueprint `rtBlueprintLocked` per-entity lock. The lock (blueprint layer)
  decides whether the blueprint touches an entity at all; `isRuntimeState`
  (import layer) decides — assuming the entity is being imported — which
  specific attributes survive the upsert.
- **What it does not do**: preservation only rewrites the incoming model
  in-memory, so the actual import stays a `ReplaceOne`. Attributes not in the
  import model are still cleared on the upsert in line with prior behaviour;
  preservation can only *replace* an imported value for an attribute the model
  already declares. Fresh tenants / brand-new entities (no existing entity)
  are silent no-ops.

- **Record-typed values need converting, not copying (AB#4784)**: the value
  read from the repository is in *repository* shape, the import model holds
  *transport* shape. They coincide for every scalar type, which is why a raw
  assignment worked for the overwhelming majority of runtime-state attributes —
  but a `Record` / `RecordArray` value is an `RtRecord` on one side and an
  `RtRecordTcDto` on the other, and handing the former over made the import throw
  `InvalidCastException` in `AssignAttributes`. The import is atomic, so the whole
  seed failed. In practice this hit exactly one attribute,
  `System.Communication/Values` (the Helm `ValueOverride`s), which blocked adopting
  any existing tenant into a blueprint that seeds a workload. `ToTransportValue`
  now converts before assigning.

  It deliberately does **not** reuse `RtEntityToTcDtoConverter`: that one serves
  export, where it *skips* runtime-state attributes and may resolve enum keys to
  names. Both are wrong here — preserving means carrying the existing value over
  verbatim, including nested runtime-state attributes, or the value would be
  silently truncated on the way through. Enum keys pass through unresolved because
  `AssignAttributes` accepts key or name.

The testable seam is the pure
`ImportRtModelCommand.PreserveAttributesForEntity` static helper, exposed
via `InternalsVisibleTo`. It takes the conversion as a `Func<object?, object?>`
so it stays free of the CK cache; production passes `ToTransportValue`. Tests in
`tests/Runtime.Engine.Tests/Exchange/ImportRtModelCommandPreserveAttributesForEntityTests.cs`
cover: flagged+both-sides → preserved; unflagged → imported value wins; mixed;
model-only (additive CK bump) → imported value lands; existing-only (model
omits the attr) → no-op; multi-attribute independence; the stream-data
`Archive.Status` activated-survives-re-import / fresh-import-keeps-Disabled cases;
and (AB#4784) that the preserved value is handed to the converter rather than
copied raw — including the `RecordArray` case the suite was missing, which is why
the bug shipped. The conversion itself is covered by
`ImportRtModelCommandToTransportValueTests` against the real CK cache fixture
(record → DTO with matching record / attribute ids, per-element array conversion,
missing record attribute stays omitted rather than nulled, scalar and string
pass-through).

#### Attribute Ownership (AB#5187)

`isRuntimeState` answered two independent questions with one bit — *who owns
the value on Upsert?* (preservation, `ImportRtModelCommand`) and *is the value
part of the entity's portable definition?* (exclusion from `ExportRt`,
`RtEntityToTcDtoConverter`). They agree for a rotating refresh token and for a
product endpoint, and they collide for tenant master data — a tariff, an IBAN,
a market-partner id, a logo — which must be preserved AND exported. The boolean
forced authors to pick one loss, and two teams picked opposite ones in the same
sprint.

`ownership` replaces it with four one-word answers:

| `ownership` | Blueprint re-apply / Upsert | `ExportRt` | Typical |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| `SeedOwned` (default, `== isRuntimeState: false`) | seed value wins | exported | product endpoints, report template names, statutory defaults, well-known-name wiring, taxonomy |
| `TenantOwned` (new) | existing tenant value wins | **exported** | tariffs, IBAN + account holder, market-partner ids, tenant mailbox/host/port, branding, app title, logos, colours |
| `RuntimeState` (`== isRuntimeState: true`) | existing value wins | excluded | deployment/communication status, last-error pairs, sync cursors, execution history, debug toggles, operator-written chart version/hostname |
| `Secret` (new) | existing value wins | excluded | client secrets, API keys, bot tokens, passwords, private keys, refresh tokens |

`Secret` behaves like `RuntimeState` today. It earns its place because it is the
honest name (an API key is not "runtime state"), because a later export opt-in
must be able to re-include `RuntimeState` while never including a secret, and
because a later redaction / vault feature needs something a bool cannot carry.

**No flag day.** `AttributeOwnership.Resolve` maps `ownership` when declared,
otherwise the alias (`true → RuntimeState`, `false`/absent → `SeedOwned`), so
every declaration that exists resolves with zero behaviour change. Declaring
both is an authoring error (`OCTO-CK003`, the lint); the engine still resolves
it deterministically with `ownership` winning. Once `ownership` is declared,
`CkAttributeDto.IsRuntimeState` becomes a computed **mirror** of
`IsPreservedOnUpsert()` — true for `TenantOwned`, `RuntimeState` and `Secret` —
which is serialised into the compiled model and persisted by the CK-model
repository, so an engine that does not know `ownership` yet degrades to
preserve-and-exclude (today's behaviour) instead of regressing to "seed wins"
and resetting credentials.

**Per-assignment override.** Ownership sits on the attribute DEFINITION and is
copied into every assignment, but one definition is shared by many types — a
single `ClientId` is assigned by `FinApiConfiguration`,
`MicrosoftGraphConfiguration` and `ServiceAccountConfiguration`. A type-attribute
or record-attribute assignment may therefore override it
(`CkTypeAttributeDto.Ownership`, nullable, `null` = inherit — so existing models
are untouched). The definition carries the common case; the outlier states its
own answer next to the type it belongs to.

**Two granularities, on purpose.** Preservation inspects only top-level type
attributes (`AllAttributes`, inherited included) and preserves a record-valued
attribute as one unit, verbatim including nested members. Export recurses into
records and evaluates each member individually. Both are right for what they do,
but the consequence is an authoring trap: a `TenantOwned` record whose members
were left `RuntimeState` exports with those members silently stripped. Give
record members the same ownership as the record-valued attribute that contains
them.

**Marked is not frozen.** A CK migration `Update` action (with a target
selector, a condition and `onConflict`) is the sanctioned, versioned, auditable
way to correct a tenant-owned value across tenants. The choice is "the seed can
change it silently" vs "changing it costs a migration", not "changeable" vs
"frozen".

Author guidance — answer the first question that applies and stop:

1. Is it a credential, token, key or password — anything you would not paste
   into a ticket? → `Secret`
2. Is it written by a service, operator, pipeline or job rather than typed by a
   human (status, timestamps, counters, error history, cursors, rotated tokens,
   deployed hostname/chart version, debug toggles)? → `RuntimeState`
3. Would a tenant admin set this in the product and be right to be angry if a
   product update overwrote it? → `TenantOwned`
4. Otherwise it ships with the product and a new version must be able to correct
   it. → `SeedOwned`

Tie-breakers: if you cannot name how a correction would reach every tenant,
choose `SeedOwned` — that is the reversible mistake. Credential tuples travel
together (host, client id, secret, username, sandbox flag): one member left
`SeedOwned` produces half a credential, which fails like no credential but looks
configured in the Studio. Before marking a shared definition, check who else
uses the attribute id and use the per-assignment override rather than making the
strictest consumer win by accident.

The `CkLintRuntimeStateMarkers` MSBuild task (opt-in per project via
`OctoEnforceRuntimeStateMarkers`) accepts either marker and rejects an attribute
that declares neither (`OCTO-CK001`), both (`OCTO-CK003`), or an unknown
ownership value (`OCTO-CK004`).

### CK Model Migrations
CK Model Migrations update runtime entities when CK model versions change. See `docs/ck-model-migrations.md` for details.

CK migration classes live in dedicated namespaces (separate from Blueprints):
- Contracts: `Runtime.Contracts.CkModelMigrations` (`ICkModelMigrationService`, `ICkMigrationContentProvider`, `ICkModelUpgradeService`)
- DTOs: `ConstructionKit.Contracts.ModelCatalogs.DataTransferObjects` (`CkMigrationMetaDto`, `CkMigrationScriptDto`, etc.)
- Engine: `Runtime.Engine.CkModelMigrations` (implementations)
- `IRuntimeRepositoryProvider` is in top-level `Runtime.Contracts`

Key services:
- `ICkModelMigrationService` - Executes migrations between CK model versions
- `ICkMigrationContentProvider` - Provides migration scripts (embedded resources or file system)
- `ICkMigrationParser` - Parses YAML migration scripts

Migration scripts location: `ConstructionKit/migrations/`

MSBuild property to control embedding: `OctoEmbedCkMigrations` (default: true)

Path resolution order: Direct → Multi-Hop → Auto-Bridge → Partial → No-Migrations Bridge → No Path

**Auto-bridging**: The engine automatically bridges version gaps at both ends of the migration chain. When the tenant's installed version is older than the earliest migration entry point, a no-op bridge step is created. When the chain doesn't reach the exact target version, the partial path is executed and the rest is treated as schema-only.

**No-migrations bridge**: When a CK model defines no migration scripts at all but the target version is strictly greater than the installed version, the entire `fromVersion → toVersion` jump is treated as a single schema-only no-op step. This means purely additive CK-model bumps (e.g. adding a new type) need no migration scripts at all — `FindMigrationPathAsync` synthesises the no-op path. Downgrades and same-version calls without scripts still return null. See `docs/ck-model-migrations.md` for the full path-resolution order.

Developers only need to create migration scripts for versions that actually transform data.

## Key Interfaces

| Interface | Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `ICkModelMigrationService` | `Runtime.Contracts.CkModelMigrations` | Executes CK model migrations |
| `ICkMigrationContentProvider` | `Runtime.Contracts.CkModelMigrations` | Provides migration content (embedded/file system) |
| `ICkModelUpgradeService` | `Runtime.Contracts.CkModelMigrations` | Auto-checks and executes CK model upgrades |
| `ICkModelImportAuditTrail` | `Runtime.Contracts.CkModelMigrations` | Records noteworthy CK-model import events (e.g. extensible-enum overrides). Default impl writes warning logs; host can register an event-repository adapter to surface entries in the platform event log. |
| `IRuntimeRepositoryProvider` | `Runtime.Contracts` | Provides runtime repositories for tenants |
| `IBlueprintService` | `Runtime.Contracts.Blueprints` | Applies blueprints to tenants |
| `ICatalogService` | `ConstructionKit.Contracts.Services` | Manages CK model catalog |

## Extensible Enum Import (WI #3324)

Enums marked `isExtensible: true` allow runtime additions via the customize-API. When a new
CK model version is imported, custom extension values are preserved into the new model
revision; if a custom value collides with a CK-defined value on the same numeric key, the
custom value takes precedence and the collision is reported via `ICkModelImportAuditTrail`
so it appears in the platform event log. The preservation/override logic itself lives in the
MongoDB layer (`DatabaseCkModelRepository.PreserveExtensibleEnumValues`); the engine layer
owns the audit-trail contract and a logging default.

## Audit-Trail Architecture

Engine code surfaces noteworthy events through typed audit-trail interfaces
(`ICkModelImportAuditTrail`, `IArchiveAuditTrail`, …). All of them route through a single
host-side extensibility point: `IAuditEventSink`.

```
Runtime.Contracts/AuditTrails/
  AuditEvent       — discriminated event record (TenantId, Level, Category, Message, Metadata)
  IAuditEventSink  — single host-replaceable surface

Runtime.Engine/AuditTrails/
  LoggingAuditEventSink   — default; writes structured logs via ILogger
  NoOpAuditEventSink      — opt-in silence (tests, hosts that explicitly want events dropped)

Runtime.Engine/{CkModelMigrations,StreamData}/
  ForwardingCkModelImportAuditTrail  — implements ICkModelImportAuditTrail
  ForwardingArchiveAuditTrail        — implements IArchiveAuditTrail
  (both translate typed calls into AuditEvent and call IAuditEventSink.PublishAsync)
```

`AddRuntimeEngine` registers:

1. `IAuditEventSink → LoggingAuditEventSink` (TryAddSingleton — hosts can override)
2. `ICkModelImportAuditTrail → ForwardingCkModelImportAuditTrail` (TryAddTransient)
3. `IArchiveAuditTrail → ForwardingArchiveAuditTrail` (AddTransient)

A host that wants events in the platform event log replaces step 1 only — see
`EventRepositoryAuditEventSink` in `octo-common-services`.

**Why this shape (history matters):** WI #3324 originally landed a per-interface bridge
(`EventRepositoryCkModelImportAuditTrail`) in `octo-common-services` that ctor-captured
`IEventRepository`. That closed a DI bootstrap cycle:
`SystemContext.ctor → IDatabaseCkModelRepository → ICkModelImportAuditTrail (bridge)
→ IEventRepository → ISystemContext → …`. Host startup deadlocked in DI's `StackGuard`
(detected via `dotnet-stack` dump on a stuck integration-test agent). Routing every
audit-trail interface through one sink keeps the bridge surface a single point — the sink
implementation in common-services lazy-resolves `IEventRepository` from
`IServiceProvider`, so the bootstrap cycle cannot re-form, even if more audit-trail
interfaces are added later.

**Adding a new audit-trail interface:**

1. Define a focused typed interface in `Runtime.Contracts` (no dependency on
   `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` or the notifications stack).
2. Add a `Forwarding{Name}AuditTrail` in `Runtime.Engine` that takes `IAuditEventSink` in
   its ctor and translates typed calls into `AuditEvent`s. Pick a stable
   `Category = "{Domain}.{Event}"` and fill the `Metadata` dictionary so structured-log
   consumers can pivot. Render `Message` in the same way as the existing forwarders.
3. Register the forwarder in `AddRuntimeEngine` next to the existing ones.

**Never** add a host-side bridge class that ctor-captures `IEventRepository` or
`ISystemContext` — that re-introduces the WI #3324 cycle. Use the sink.

`LoggingCkModelImportAuditTrail` and `LoggingArchiveAuditTrail` remain in `Runtime.Engine`
for backwards-compatible direct instantiation (e.g. the manual fallback in Mongo
`TenantContext` when no DI is wired) but are no longer the registered defaults.

## Important Notes

- The solution uses Azure Pipelines for CI/CD (devops-build/azure-pipelines.yml)
- NuGet packages can be published to either public or private feeds depending on configuration
- Local development uses the DebugL configuration with local package sources
- Migration YAML files in `ConstructionKit/migrations/` are automatically embedded as resources
